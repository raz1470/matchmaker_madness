# Matchmaker Madness - How Well Do You Really Know Your Team?!

## Introduction
Get ready for a fun-filled guessing game! Can you and your teammates work together to figure out who gave which answer? It's time to see how well you really know your team!

## How does the game work?
- A team lead needs to be nominated.
- The team lead needs to think of 5 questions and then they will run an anonymous survey to collect answers from the team:
  - It is important that only the team lead see's the answers!
  - Questions can be serious, funny or obscure - A mix of these 3 usually works well!
- The questions and answers can then be uploaded to this app.
- The team then need to work together and try and figure out who gave which answer:
  - The overall aim is to score a high as possible as a team.
  - If you give away what your answer was this ruins the game!
